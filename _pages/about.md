I hold Bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science at [Universidade Federal de Goiás](http://www.inf.ufg.br/), and I'm currently Researcher at [Deep Learning Brazil Research Group](http://www.deeplearningbrasil.com.br/index.php/blog) and Student Trainee in [Institute of Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://www.i2a2.ca/). My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in reinforcement learning. I'm particularly interested in understanding human behavior in the context of exploring the capability of robots and other agents to develop broadly intelligent and complex behavior through learning and interaction.
