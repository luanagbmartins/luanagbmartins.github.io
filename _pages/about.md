I hold Bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science at [Universidade Federal de Goiás](http://www.inf.ufg.br/), and I'm currently a undergraduated researcher at [Deep Learning Brazil Research Group](http://www.deeplearningbrasil.com.br/index.php/blog) and a student tainee in [Institute of Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://www.i2a2.ca/). My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in reinforcement learning. I'm particularly interested in understanding human behavior sin the context of how learning can be used to acquire complex behavioral skills, in order to endow machines with greater autonomy and intelligence.
